# Old-Discord-client
Run an older version of the Discord app in a (less bloated, basically bare bones) Electron application thanks to Displunger.
# Why?
I just like the old Discord look, and to be honest it could be useful for somebody like me who gets driven insane everytime they see a Nitro upsell lol.
